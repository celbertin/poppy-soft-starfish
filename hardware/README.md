## Hardware

The parts have been design using [onshape](https://www.onshape.com/). The project has been made public at [this link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/56af95b6e4b06a92e0eda720/w/a53eaed345df8e54532db1e2/e/a165c83ad81843f33ed38c05)
(Note: If the link does not work, run a search for ''Poppy Soft Robot XL320'')

The stl files are also available under /hardware/molds and /hardware/parts as well as in this release.

Checkout the [BOM](BOM.md) to know how many of each to print.
